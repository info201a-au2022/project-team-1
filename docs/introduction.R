  p("Since the introduction of TikTok in 2018, it has had an 
    undeniable impact on the music industry. Songs that were once 
    looked at as \"just a popular audio snippet on Tiktok\" are now
    reaping real-world benefits by charting on credible music charts, 
    such as Spotify and BillBoard. Artists who previously had a very
    small following have been launched into mainstream culture and
    have seemingly secured their spot as a household name. As well,
    older songs are having another moment in the spotlight
    as the younger generation discovers a newfound appreciation for
    the throwbacks."),
  p("While it is easy to get swept away from the fame and celebrities
    that emerge from TikTok, there seems to be less attention on what 
    gets popular. With the relationship between social media and music
    strengthening with each passing year, we wanted to take a closer look 
    at how the music landscape has changed with the influx of the growing 
    demographic from TikTok."),
  p("To do this, we will be comparing multiple charts from different platforms 
    (TikTok and Spotify) in an effort to visualize the relationships between said 
    platforms, as well as the impact of social media in the music industry."),

  p("While exploring the data, you should keep in mind three questions:"),
  p("1) For songs that are popular on both TikTok and Spotify, how do they rank on
    each?"),
  p("2) Do certain artists do well on both TikTok and Spotify?"),
  p("3) What kind of overlap is there between popular songs on TikTok and Spotify charts?")
