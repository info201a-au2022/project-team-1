|Project Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[`/data`](./data) | File for data sets used. Should be noted that this is the `.csv` data sets, and not the various charts made for analysis; that is under the `/source` folder.
|[`/docs`](./docs) | Includes the coding for the Introduction paragraph in the final project, and the project proposal.|
|[`/instructions`](./instructions)| This directory contains the project design brief.  |
|[`/source`](./source) | R sourced code in final project.
|[`/www`](./www) | This folder contains various pictures that were used in the project
| .gitignore | This  file is important. It tells git to ignore all files that are listed therein. Ignoring "non-useful" files will make it *much* easier to work togther in your team. See Freeman and Ross (2019, section 3.6) for details.  |
| LICENSE | This is a straigtforward software license that basically says "You own the copyright of your code.  Others can use your code, so long as they cite that they are doing so." You should put your names into the LICENSE file. If you would like to use a different license, that would be fine! |
